| Layer     | Technology                  | Role   |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ------ |
| Framework | [e.g. Next.js + TypeScript] | [Role] |
| UI        | [e.g. Tailwind + shadcn/ui] | [Role] |
| Auth      | [e.g. Clerk]                | [Role] |
| Database  | [e.g. Prisma + PostgreSQL]  | [Role] |

## System Boundaries

### Resource page context (implemented)

- `components/resources/resource-context.tsx` provides a page-scoped resource name, selected action/row ID, loaded row and open/close callbacks. Each `CatalogResource` mounts its own provider, keyed by resource.
- `ResourceRowActions` and the create toolbar use that context; optional `rowActions` config supplies icon/handler definitions.
- `ResourceDialogs` mounts one keyed dialog for create/edit/delete. Catalog fields and payload mapping remain in the catalog feature. The existing Refine provider owns database requests; context selection itself performs no requests.
- Delete identity/name come from the loaded table rows. Edit reads and create/update mutations remain in `ResourceFormDialog`. No application-wide selected-row singleton is introduced.

- `[folder]` — [What this folder owns and is responsible for]
- `[folder]` — [What this folder owns and is responsible for]
- `[folder]` — [What this folder owns and is responsible for]
- `[folder]` — [What this folder owns and is responsible for]

## Storage Model

- **[Storage type e.g. Database]**: [What lives here —
  e.g. metadata, ownership, relationships]
- **[Storage type e.g. Blob/File Storage]**: [What lives
  here — e.g. generated files, media, large artifacts]

## Auth and Access Model

- [How authentication works — e.g. Every user signs in
  via Clerk]
- [How ownership works — e.g. Every project has a single
  owner]
- [How access control works — e.g. Only the owner or a
  collaborator can mutate project resources]

## Invariants

1. [Rule the codebase must never violate — e.g. Request
   handlers do not run long-lived background work]
2. [Invariant two]
3. [Invariant three]
4. [Invariant four]
